# FGW (Playpen) Library

## Summary

This is an unofficial collection of the source files for Francis Glassborow's
FGW Library, aka "Playpen". This library is used for both of his C++ titles
and is no longer available from the author's website. See the book's page on
the publisher's site for the last official version.

See [References](#References) section for links to official content.

## Changes

The following is a rough list of changes that have been applied since the
original CD release:

1. Add `fgw_headers` content from the book's CD
1. Add `Appendix D, The FGW Library` in MS Word and HTML formats
1. Add updated content extracted from `tutorial.exe` that was provided on the
   author's website  as of Nov 19, 2011.
   This content supersedes the content provided on the book's CD.
1. Add contents of `library_source.zip` that was available from the author's
   website as of Nov 19, 2011
1. Add contents of `Windows Tutorial (zip)` from the publisher's website
1. Add UNIX-specific makefile and source code
1. Remove binary library files

## License

To the best of my knowledge, the license for the library and dependent files
allows for hosting the content here for others to review (and contribute to),
but if anyone knows differently please file open an issue in this repository
and I will make it a priority to resolve the issue ASAP.

## Current status

This repo is mostly an archive of the content as it existed in mid 2012 when I
last touched it. I have no current plans to modify/maintain the content
further, though I may apply light changes in the near future to
cleanup/restructure the repo a bit.
